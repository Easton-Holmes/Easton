    <h1>Beta Fish</h1>

    <p><strong>Caretaking Instructions</strong></p>
    Beta Fish need a tank that is at least 3 gallons in size. My roomate and I<br>got a 3.5 gallon tank for our fish. Beta fish are very agresive, and they<br>cannot share a tank with another beta fish. They will also attack themselves<br>if they see their reflection, so you can't set them up near a mirrior without<br>some kind of barrier in between. There are some different species of fish that<br>they can share a tank with, and they are safe with snails.
    <p> Beta fish are tropical fish and they need warm water in order to survive. I got a water<br>heater for my fish from Amazon</p>
    <p>Fish need their water to be conditioned before you put them in a tank. Every<br>time you clean the tank you need to add water conditioner and bacteria starter<br>to the tank. Fish also need food. My roomate and I bought flakes and pebbels<br>for our fish, but beta fish have very small mouhes and he can only eat the flakes.</p>
    <p><strong>Decorations</strong></p>
    <p>It is not nessecary for fish to have decorations in their tank, but it deffinetly makes<br>them happier. For our fish, my roomate and I got pebbels, fake plants, a cave, and a<br>background paper.</p>
